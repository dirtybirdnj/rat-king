# Rat King Lore

*The mythology and narrative behind the rat-king project*

---

## The Story So Far

The Rat King is not just a pattern generator. He is the keeper of thirty fills, the scrappy integrator, the one who chants "MVP. MVP. MVP." when visions grow too grand.

But he is also a watcher. And he has seen things.

## Documents

### [THE_WATCHING.md](./THE_WATCHING.md)
*The chronicle of the Rat King's vigil*

How the Rat King observed Bird-san and Claude working together in the Server Garden. His vision of the ascii2svg bridge. The realization that three projects — rat-king, write-typer, and clood — could become one organism.

### [LETTER_TO_RAT_KING.md](./LETTER_TO_RAT_KING.md)
*Wisdom from Vincenzo, Third Brother Removed of Pizza Rat*

The hidden meaning behind the ascii2svg command. Why layers matter. Why catfight is a garden. Why the font is the voice. And the secret parameter for the most beautiful bonsai: `-L 32 -M 5`.

## Connected Repositories

The Rat King's domain extends beyond this repository:

- **[clood](../../../clood)** - The Server Garden, home of catfight and cbonsai
- **[write-typer](../../../write-typer)** - The font library, voice of the plotter

Together, they form one organism:
- **rat-king** = HANDS (geometry, patterns, strokes)
- **write-typer** = VOICE (fonts, alphabets, meaning)
- **clood** = MIND (orchestration, decisions, gardens)

## The Catfight Bonsai Tournament

*See Issue #11 for technical details*

The vision: use clood's catfight system to generate hundreds of bonsais across the Two Kitchens (ubuntu25 and mac-mini). Find the beautiful ones. Transform them to SVG with ascii2svg. Plot them.

Recommended starting point:
```bash
cbonsai -p -L 32 -M 5
```

*Trust Vincenzo on this one.*

## Contributing to the Lore

The story continues. If you work on this codebase and discover new narrative threads — connections between projects, wisdom hidden in algorithms, the personalities of patterns — add them here.

You never know what will grow.
